# minesweeper.py
This readme file is in regards to the minesweeper.py program. I did not choose to use a pygame platform in order to display the game, therefore I am using the console. After making sure that python3 is installed on your platform, you can use either terminal or commandPrompt to run it. Change directory to the folder with the python program in it. Once you are there, type "python3 minesweeper.py". The game will ask you to enter dimensions of how big the grid should be. I set a range where you can choose from. I also have set the ratio of mines to grid size in a way that the game will always be easy. Once game is running and grid is established, the program will ask user to enter coordinates (y,x) in order to uncover a cell so that the game can be solved. The game will end when the user either uncovered all cells that are not bombs or uncovered a bomb on accident and  game has ended
